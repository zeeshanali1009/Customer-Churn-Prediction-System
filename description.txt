🎯 Client Problem Statement (Realistic)
“We are a telecom company. Customers are leaving our service.
We want an ML system that predicts whether a customer will churn or not, so we can take action before losing them.”

Customer Churn Prediction System – Project Description
1. Project Overview
The Customer Churn Prediction System is designed to predict whether a customer is likely to leave a service (churn) or stay loyal. Accurately predicting churn allows businesses to proactively retain valuable customers and improve overall profitability. This system uses machine learning classification techniques to analyze customer behavior and predict churn based on historical data.

2. Dataset
Source: Telco Customer Churn dataset (can be publicly sourced from Kaggle or internal company data).
Description: The dataset includes customer demographics, service usage, account information, and subscription details.
Key Features:
Customer demographics: Gender, SeniorCitizen, Partner, Dependents
Account information: Tenure, Contract, PaperlessBilling, PaymentMethod
Services subscribed: PhoneService, InternetService, OnlineSecurity, StreamingTV, etc.
Financials: MonthlyCharges, TotalCharges
Target variable: Churn (Yes/No)
Size: Approximately 7043 records (after preprocessing).

3. Project Objective
The primary goal of this project is to build a predictive model that identifies customers at risk of churning. This enables companies to take preventive actions such as targeted marketing campaigns or personalized retention strategies.

4. Methodology
Data Exploration (EDA):
Examined feature distributions and relationships.
Identified missing values and outliers.
Analyzed churn distribution to handle class imbalance.
Data Preprocessing:
Handled missing values in TotalCharges and Churn.
Encoded categorical variables using label encoding and one-hot encoding.
Normalized numeric features where necessary.
Model Training:
Split the dataset into training and testing sets (80:20).
Used Random Forest Classifier for prediction due to its robustness and ability to handle mixed data types.
Evaluated model performance using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC.
Model Saving and Deployment:
Saved trained model and preprocessing objects using joblib.
Built a Streamlit app to take user inputs and predict churn probability in real-time.

5. Key Results
Model successfully predicts customer churn with an accuracy of ~82% on the test set.
The app displays the probability of churn and indicates whether a customer is likely to stay or leave.
The system can handle various customer profiles and provide actionable insights for retention strategies.
